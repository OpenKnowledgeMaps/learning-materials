# “I didn’t know I could know so much!" The open science way to do literature research
*Created by Maxi Schramm & Peter Kraker with input from the whole [Open Knowledge Maps team](http://openknowledgemaps.org/team)*

### Intro
As a researcher you know this situation: you need to get an overview of an unknown field of research - and you need it fast. In this exercise, you will learn how to approach this task using Open Knowledge Maps, a visual discovery tool.

We’d appreciate if you shared your notes with the other study groups and with us. That way, we can learn from each other’s feedback: https://pad.okfn.org/p/study-groups-okmaps


### Warm-up
Before we get started, a little warm-up first:
Get together in groups of two and discuss the following questions:
* How do you get an overview of an unknown research field?
* What are the problems and challenges that you are facing?

After about 5 minutes, share what you’ve discussed with the others in the group.

### Presentation of Open Knowledge Maps
Ready to get our perspective on the topic? Want to find out what Open Knowledge Maps is all about? Great! Next, we’ve recorded an introduction at OpenCon Berlin for you. You can find it here: https://vimeo.com/196899407

### Hands-on session

Now it’s time to get your hands dirty and try the tool yourselves.
Get together in groups of three – each group should have at least one laptop between them (at this moment, the desktop version works best).
Try to solve one of the following tasks using both Open Knowledge Maps (http://openknowledgemaps.com) and your favourite discovery tool:
* Get an overview on the research on the internet of things. What were the topics discussed in 2015? How did that change in 2016?
* Get an overview of research topics on men and on women. What are the differences? Are the topics different between the two sources (PubMed and DOAJ)?

Share your insights with the other groups. Did you all get to the same conclusions? What were the differences between your usual discovery tool and Open Knowledge Maps?

### Future plans

To round things out, we’d like to give you a glimpse into our future plans. Here’s a short video describing our vision for collaborative editing: https://vimeo.com/188647919
